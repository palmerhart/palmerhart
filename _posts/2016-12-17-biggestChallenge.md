<h3>Biggest challenges faced with learning to code</h3>

Learning to code has certainly provided it's fair share of challenges.  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, Github....you need to learn a lot very quickly.  It's like learning a new language, because...well because it is learning new languages.  There is a lot of memorization in the begining, but the basics  can quickly turn into muscle memory with enough repititions.

<h5>Read, Set, it's Broken...time to sudo</h5>
Just when you think you have "fixed the bug" your realize you are going about it the wrong way.  While you have to memorize a lot of commands, you also need to layer on concepts to what you are doing.  One of the biggest helps to me is first writing "sudo-code" in plain english for what you are trying to achieve, then re-write that with the appropriate code from the appropriate language.  This helps you reason through what you are trying to accomplish in a language you are familiar with, then break up the coding exercise into manageable chunks.

<h5>An Ocean of Resources</h5>
If you are just learning to code, start cleaning up your shortcuts bar!!  That is probably one of the best tips no-one told me from the get-go.  The reason I say this is the amount of documentation on the web is incredible.  This is not all that surprising as the people that make applications are the ones that have the knowledge on how to make them, and fortunately for us newbs the community is absolutely wonderful and loves to share.  Once I started making the appropriate shortcut bar folders and sub-folders, I was able to quickly access all of the right information by language and type of reference materials.  From CodeSchools to CodeWars to CodePen, there are a boat-load of resources out there!

<h5>Light at the end of the tunnel</h5>
Clearing one hurdle after the next starts to build confidence in taking on future code learning exercises.  One of the most empowering exercises for me has been learning to debug.  Often times it's not working and you feel lost, but using tools like Chrome's web-developer "inspection" feature has changed my experience!  Going from "I'm totally lost" to "I think I might have found it" can be a length journey, but the more time I have spent debugging, the more confident I am at finding future bugs and resolving isssues quickly.
