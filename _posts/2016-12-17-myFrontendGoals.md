<h3>My Goals for Frontend Development</h3>

I never really liked cookie cutters.  While at first a fun as a child, you realize they do not have much versatility and they occupy space in your kitchen droors.  I guess I never really liked the idea of not having the ability to customize something.  I often times find myself in a big-box retail store thinking...this isn't quite what I want but it will have to do.

Other times I decide against picking from a narrow list of options, or even a larger group of options online.  For my most important decisions I find that I want something custom, something just for me.

When it came time to pick a desk I had a long list of needs:
1.  Space for multiple monitors
2.  An ability to stand-up
3.  Ample workspace for non-computer projects.
4.  A dark wood design<br>
....and the list goes on

I quickly found that I was not going to get what I wanted from one retailers, so I started to sketch up what I wanted in a notepad and build it myself!  After the planning phase I ordered a stand-up desk kit on Amazon, went to the hardware store for wood, piping, stain and sandpaper, picked up a long power-strip and some cable management supplies from the local computer store.

Then I build the desk of my dreams, something I enjoy using every day!

I share this story because I feel the same way about web applications....I don't always get my needs met and I wanted to be empowered to build them myself.  I toyed around with wordpress and drupal, but ultimately decided I need to learn to code!!  A well built application can make a world of difference, and I mean that sincerely due to the scalability.

Now it's time to build my skillset, and here is the wish-list:
1.  Learn frontend Web Development to make my applications user friendly and interactive
2.  Learn back-end develpment for sophisticated applications that leverage various API's and databases
3.  Learn to make it from scratch!!!  No cookie cutters required!
