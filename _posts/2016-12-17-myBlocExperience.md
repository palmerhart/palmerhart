<h3>My experience with Bloc</h3>

<h4>Ready, set, Code!</h4>

Two months in to Bloc I can already say it's been a rewarding experience....full of pain and agony!  I mean that in the best way possible, because I am challenged daily and the breakthrough moments make all of the headaches worth it!

When I first enrolled I was excited about the idea of becoming a "full-stack developer".  While the idea of learning to make applications seemed daunting, I thought the curriculam appeared to break things into managable chunks.  Learning multiple languages also seemed like quite the challenges, but becoming a well-rounded developer is the end goal, so exposure to various languages is important.

The course starts off with some intro level material in what is effectively a sandbox environment, so you can't mess anything up to bad!  I think the curriculum does a good job of graduating you to different tools and technologies.  Every checkpoint completed is one hurdle passed, but you know there is another one right after that.

<h4>The Mentor</h4>
While completing a few tutorials on-line prior to joining Bloc, I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere without a Mentor.  Learning to code can be very unforgiving at times, miss one small character, swap `,` for a `;` and your entire app breaks!  Having the ability to check-in with someone and get "un-stuck" makes a world of difference.  There have been times where I have been able to "pass a test" but was paroting code blocks without really understanding what I was doing, talking through the code with your Mentor can solidify your understanding of the lesson.

<h4>Keeping on..</h4>
Although I know there will be headaches ahead, I am very much so looking forward to the rest of the curriculum.  I would love to say some of the challenges are "Goldilocks" tasks (not to hot, not too cold), the reality is there will be some difficult ones...but I look forward to the breakthroughs and the new skills I will acquire in the process!
